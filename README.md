# Notes for the semester
This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. I am not always on top of my stuff, so I am going to continually update this over the semester. I plan to have this done before exams hopefully. Furthermore, a warning to those planning to use these. I don't write everything (for example, for COMP330 I don't draw any of the DFAs since I use those as practice later on, also it's kind of a pain to have to draw them using google draw or whatever). I only write stuff that I think is important. I also like to add my own dialogue in my notes, so if you see some weird comments, it's just cause I add them when I'm bored. I added the actual latex markdown if you want to add from my notes. If you're going to do this though, just know it's incredibly time consuming especially if you don't know latex.

If you find a mistake, just email me: chany.ahn@mail.mcgill.ca.

Good luck with school.
